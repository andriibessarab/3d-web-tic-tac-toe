![](./client/public/assets/gifs/single=player-preview.gif)
 
Multi-Tac is a Tic Tac Toe online game developed by Andrii Bessarab
as a final project for the ICS3U course. The game is built using
React, Three.js, SQL, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Socket.io. It features
online multiplayer, single-player against an unbeatable AI, and local
game modes. The application is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed
at [multi-tac.herokuapp.com](https://multi-tac.herokuapp.com). 🎮🌐🚀

## 🔒 Authentication and User Accounts
The game provides authentication functionality,
allowing users to create accounts, login, and logout.
The data is stored on Heroku Postgres DB with passwords
being hashed with [BCrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/authentication),
a password hashing algorithm designed by Niels Provos and David
Mazières based on the Blowfish cipher. 🔒🔐

## 🎲 Game Modes

### 🌐 Online Multiplayer 🌐

In this mode, you can play Tic Tac Toe against another player online. To start a game, one player can generate a unique code 🎟️, and the other player can join by entering that code ⌨️. This allows you to invite friends or challenge opponents to a game. The game operates over Socket.io, enabling real-time communication between players. 📡💬

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Player 1**: Go to the **Online Game** section and click on **Create Game**.
2. **Player 1**: A unique code 🎟️ will be generated for your game.
3. **Player 2**: Go to the **Online Game** section and click on **Join Game**.
4. **Player 2**: Enter the code 🎟️ generated by Player 1 to join their game.
5. **Player 1 and Player 2**: Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe against each other in real time! 🎉✨

Remember, this feature utilizes Socket.io to provide a seamless online experience.
It enables you to make moves and receive updates from your opponent instantly. Have
fun and may the best player win! 🏆🎮

### Single Player
🤖 Challenge yourself against an AI opponent! It offers three difficulty levels to choose from:

| Difficulty | Description                                                                                       |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Easy       | 🌟 The AI makes random moves, providing a relatively easier gameplay experience.                  |
| Normal     | 🔄 The AI combines random moves and minimax algorithm, creating a balanced challenge for players. |
| Hard       | 🏆 The AI utilizes the unbeatable minimax algorithm to provide the ultimate challenge.            |

**🙌 Special Thanks** to Cledersonbc whose implementation of the minimax 
algorithm has been taken as a base for this game. [Vew original repository.](https://github.com/Cledersonbc/tic-tac-toe-minimax)


### 🎮 Local Game 🎮

Play Tic Tac Toe locally with a friend on the same device. This mode allows you to enjoy the classic game with a personal touch. Take turns placing your symbols and strategize to achieve victory. 🕹️✨🤝

## 📅 Development Timeline
The development of this project spanned over two months, involving
coding, testing, and refining. There is still a lot that can be
improved and optimized; however, the game has finally achieved
a functioning state. ⏳🚀

## 🙏 Special Thanks
I would like to thank the following amazing GitHub members for
making my life easier. I shamelessly used code from some of their
public repositories in my app, and the least I can do to credit them is
to mention their pages here:

- [Suboptimal Engineer](https://github.com/SuboptimalEng): (3d tic-tac-toe board) 🙌
- [Clederson Cruz](https://github.com/Cledersonbc/): (minimax algorithm for single player) 🙌

Feel free to explore the game and provide any feedback or suggestions. Have fun playing Multi Tac online! 😄🎉
